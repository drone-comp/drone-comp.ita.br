We aim at creating a data collection system capable of dealing with
multiplatform and multi-sensor (multispectral imaging, humidity, temperature,
and others) data to build artificial intelligence models to predict wildfire
risk in a coverage area.

The data collection, data annotation, and data fusion system will handle
different categories of data and platforms, as well as be easily integrated
with other data systems related to the problem, such as information from
satellites, vegetation maps, or other structured and unstructured data.

This project is under the Air Domain Study (ADS) project, a Brazil-Sweden
Cooperation in Aeronautics, whose objective is to better understand the future
of the air domain.

These activities will gradually expand knowledge and support stakeholder
efforts to position themselves in the future landscape of global aeronautics.
